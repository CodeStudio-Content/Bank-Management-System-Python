## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following functions:

- `__init__(self, master)` : This function initializes the BankSystem object with the specified parameters, sets the title and geometry of the main window, and creates the "Create Account" and "Login" frames.
- `create_account()` : This function creates a new account with the name, age, salary, and PIN entered by the user in the corresponding Entry widgets. It adds the account details to a dictionary and saves the dictionary to a file using the `pickle` module.
- `login()` : This function validates the entered PIN against the saved account details and displays the account information if the PIN is correct.
- `load_accounts()` : This function loads the saved account details from the file using the `pickle` module and returns the dictionary.

### The code also defines the following labels and buttons for the game:

- Labels:
    - `name_label` : This label displays "Name:" in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `age_label` : This label displays "Age:" in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `salary_label` : This label displays "Salary:" in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `pin_label` : This label displays "PIN:" in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `login_pin_label` : This label displays "PIN:" in the "Login" frame.
- Entry widgets:
    - `name_entry` : This Entry widget allows the user to enter their name in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `age_entry` : This Entry widget allows the user to enter their age in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `salary_entry` : This Entry widget allows the user to enter their salary in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `pin_entry` : This Entry widget allows the user to enter their PIN in the "Create Account" frame.
    - `login_pin_entry` : This Entry widget allows the user to enter their PIN in the "Login" frame.
